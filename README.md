# Chess Vision

This is a simple game designed to improve your chessboard vision inspired in the minigame on chess.com. You'll be presented with random chess coordinates, and your goal is to quickly click the corresponding square on the board. The project was built using Vite and TypeScript over three live streams on Twitch. The code is basic and the design is minimal, but it was a fun and interactive experience!
